# Leveson-Based Trade Assessment Scale
A trade assessment scale based on Nancy Leveson's Software Assessment Scale developed for evaluating software used in airborne vehicles. 

Contemporary trade assessments based on 5-star systems do not provide data that motivates producer improvement. Developed in the United States, apparently by Forbes Travel Guide, formerly Mobil Travel Guide, in 1958. This system was used to advertise hotel quality along popular travel routes as part of a larger campaign to encourage cross-country driving trips using the new US interstate highway system and was never meant to be a two-way communication system. As a result, ratings hold little to no value in e-commerce where they are most commonly applied. In many cases, PR managers place minimal effort toward rationalizing with customers and represent a barrier to companies changing internal policies to improve customer experience. 

The Leveson System was developed in the high-stakes arena of aircraft software development where if a system fails, someone dies or at the very least, tens of thousands of dollars in research and development investments are wasted. Leveson still uses a similar 6-point system with ratings from positive 4 to negative 1. Leveson also further defines each category allowing users to compress more meaning behind the rating. This reduces the need for comment sections for more data. 

SCALE DESCRIPTIONS (Adapted)
+4 
Delight
Interaction anticipates the evolution of user practices and concerns post-transaction

+3
No Negative Consequences
Interaction designed to prevent loss, exceed basic quality

+2
Basic Satisfaction
Interaction meets socially acceptable standards exceeding articulated user demands

+1
Basic Promise
Interaction meets all articulated user demands, no more

0
Cynical Satisfaction
Interaction fulfills a basic promise requiring little to no discipline toward user satisfaction

-1
No Trust
User was harmed, exploited, or received a product or service with evidence of no discipline or malicious intent

Though not a two-way communication system on its own, assessments may be levied against both consumer and producer in a digital human-based computation network/mass production network; identifying bad actors on both sides of transactions for future users. For example, a network may maintain average ratings for producers to identify unskilled providers, and a consumer rating to identify exploitative or difficult customers.
